# Real-Time Satellite Tracker

A real-time satellite tracking application that visualizes satellites orbiting Earth in 3D, providing real-time trajectory data and detailed satellite information.

---

## Features
- **3D Earth Model:** Displays a 3D Earth with satellites visualized as dots.
- **Real-Time Satellite Trajectories:** Tracks and visualizes satellite movements in real time.
- **Interactive Satellite Info:** Click on any satellite to view detailed information about it in the bottom-right corner.
- **Artificial Satellite Data:** Uses artificial data for satellite positions (future versions may integrate live satellite data).

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **LWJGL (Lightweight Java Game Library):** Handles real-time computations and backend logic for satellite tracking.

### Frontend
- **Three.js:** Powers the 3D Earth model and UI visualization.

### IDE
- **IntelliJ IDEA:** Development environment for seamless integration and efficient project management.
